Vlasiator
---------

`**Vlasiator** <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator>`_ (`GitHub <https://github.com/fmihpc/vlasiator>`_) is the state-of-the-art hybrid-Vlasov simulation for ion-scale physics in a global magnetospheric setting. It is the only 6D hybrid-Vlasov code capable of simulating the Earth's magnetosphere. In Vlasiator, ions are represented as velocity distribution functions, while electrons are massless charge-neutralizing fluid, enabling a self-consistent global plasma simulation that can describe multi-temperature plasmas to resolve non-MHD processes that currently cannot be self-consistently described by the existing global space weather simulations. The novelty is that by modelling ions as velocity distribution functions the outcome will be numerically noiseless. Due to the multi-dimensional approach at ion scales, Vlasiator's computational challenges are immense.

Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation,

which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current.

State-of-the-art
----------------

Vlasiator is parallelized at multiple scales via MPI, threading support and vectorization, and we are continuously improving the performance and the feature set. GPU porting is in progress: solvers have been ported, but they need to be optimized for GPUs to be useful in production.

The data structures in Vlasiator have been optimized to propagate the 6D solution efficiently with explicit solvers. The velocity distribution functions are associated with a spatial, hierarchically-adapted Cartesian grid (the Vlasov grid, SpatialGrid or the AMR grid), with each such spatial cell containing a VDF for each ion species in the simulation. The VDF themselves are stored on a Cartesian velocity-space grid as a sparse data structure - otherwise the production simulations could not fit any available computers. This implies slight loss of mass at the fringes (under a set sparsity threshold, the VDF is not stored), but the VDF can optionally be re-scaled to conserve mass. Suitably chosen sparsity thresholds enable global runs with negligible adverse effects. Some 98% of the phase-space volume is discarded.

    Example of sparse velocity grid. The 4x4x4 structure stems from the block data structure.

The numerical algorithm for the propagation of the Vlasov equation is based on operator splitting: spatial translation and velocity-space acceleration are leapfrogged. Spatial translation remaps the VDF as 1D shears. The acceleration re-mapping of the VDF is handled by the semi-Lagrangian SLICE-3D method by Zerroukat and Allen (2012), by decomposing v-space rotation and translation to a series of shear operations. These mappings are conservative by themselves.

Spatial AMR has lately enabled truly 6D simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere (see Ganse+2023). The initial 6D production runs have used statically-refined grid, with a dynamic AMR currently being tested in production.

Spatial AMR, however, is *not* extended to the field solver (*heterologous* grids): Field solver has simple load balancing, while the Vlasov solver does not. The solution is to have *two* grids, with the field solver grid at the highest resolution of the Vlasov grid, throughout the entire domain. There are some details in cross-coupling e.g. plasma moments across these grids. With four levels of refinement, the field solver is contributing about 10% of runtime as it is - Vlasov solver is still the bottleneck.

Improved load balancing algorithms matter. In the above Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) example, one can see small-scale structure in the domain boundaries, which is not optimal for MPI communication buffers. Forcing rectilinear domains for RCB helps, but so do using other methods, like Recursive Inertial Bisection (RIB, below), that can balance MPI communications over the three principal directions.

Recently, we have also included a proper ionospheric inner boundary condition, with an ionosphere solver along the lines of MHD solvers. Further developments are ongoing, incl. better ionization and conductivity profiles. Outer boundary conditions now include the possibility of time-varying solar wind parameters.

Lately, we have included an electron module, eVlasiator (`Battarbee+2021 <https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-85-2021>`_, `Alho+2022 <https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098329>`_), that takes an existing Vlasiator solution and runs electron VDFs against that background.

Deploying Vlasiator to various environments has lately (with Plasma-PEPSC!) been made much easier, including compilation on ARM. We'll look at the build process later!

Practical aspects of running Vlasiator
--------------------------------------

What sorts on constraints does Vlasiator have?

Six-dimensional simulations are expensive! Further, there are some constraints from physics on resolution - if you want to be accurate, you will need to resolve some scales.

#. Timestep: Ion cyclotron frequency.
   
   Especially restrictive with global magnetospheric simulations with high magnetic field values close to the poles, with an r^-3 dependence.

   We constrain the timestep to provide a maximum of 22 degrees of cyclotron rotation per step. Further, the Vlasov solver timestep is *so far* a global timestep. This is a bottleneck for the inner boundary.

#. Velocity-space resolution: numerical heating

   Low velocity-space resolution is constrained by thermal velocity: dv ~< v_th/3. For exampe, solar wind Maxwellians exhibit numerical heating for dv >~ v_th/3.

#. Velocity-space sparsity threshold

   Around 10^-15 m^6 s^-3 has been found a decent compromise for the sparsity threshold, retaining the parts of VDFs that are relevant for the dynamics of the system. If you wish to model high-energy tails, the threshold should be pushed down... at the cost of significantly increased memory footprint.

#. Velocity-space extents

   +- 4000...8000 km/s are decent extents for terrestrial magnetospheric simulations with the current sparsity thresholds. Usually VDFs 'hit the walls' only when there is anomalous acceleration, or otherwise very fast and/or hot flows. This results in 200..400 velocity cells per dimension in our usual runs. Sparsity really saves on the memory footprint!

#. Spatial resolution

   Preferably, ion kinetic scale should be resolved (~200 km in Earth's magnetosphere). In 6D global production runs, we have not yet reached this (max resolution 1000 km). 5D runs can go to sufficient resolution - plenty of foreshock studies!
   
   Anomalous effects can be seen in the magnetosheath, for example. 1000 km resolution does not resolve all relevant EMIC waves, leading to anomalous loss-cone distributions. See e.g. `Dubart+2023 <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0176376>`_ for ongoing work towards a subgrid diffusion model to mimic the effects of these waves.

#. Spatial extents

   Outflow boundaries are simple copy-condition boundaries. For example, the bow shock hitting the outer walls should be avoided, leading to approx. +- 60 RE simulation extents for the Earth.

What can I do?
--------------

Let's see what *has* been done.

* ULF wave field studies, see `Turc et al., 2022 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-022-01837-z>`_, Transmission of foreshock waves through Earthâ€™s bow shock. *Nat. Phys*.

  5D/2D runs - can resolve ion kinetic scales. Topics include generation of counterstreaming foreshock populations, resulting ULF wave fields, and their effects!

  Similar runs are now being run at O(10M) CPUh on Mahti (CSC/Finland). Smaller 2D runs have been nowaways performed also on our local cluster of 10 nodes of 2x AMD Epyc 7302/32 cores per node.

* Relatedly: Jets and SLAMS, see the works by Joonas Suni, e.g., `Suni et al., <https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL095655>`_

* Reconnection in a global context `Palmroth et al. 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01206-2>`_, Magnetotail plasma eruptions driven by magnetic reconnection and kinetic instabilities. *Nat. Geosci*.

  These are huge runs at several tens of MCPU-hours.

  Ion kinetics make the reconnection phenomena very dynamic, presenting need for more tools for finding them. See `Alho et al., 2023 (revised) <https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2300>`_

* Directly utilize the VDF data of the global simulations, e.g. in precipitation of particles from magnetospheric processes, both from 2D (`Grandin et al. 2019 <https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-791-2019>`_) and 3D simulations (`Grandin et al. 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1051/swsc/2023017>`)

* Local ion-kinetic simulations, e.g. Kelvin-Helmholz instabilities (Tarvus et al, in prep.), EMIC wave studies (`Dubart et al. 2023 <https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0176376>`_, with *many* small simulations), shock tube simulations (YPK)... More discussion on Vlasiator projects later.

See the `Vlasiator website/publications <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator/publications-and-presentations>`_ for more examples!

We note that since these runs are expensive, we often mine multiple papers out of a single run.


Rules of the Road
=================

As noted at the `Vlasiator website <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator/rules-of-the-road>`_.

*Vlasiator is a significant investment, and its development has taken many years (since 2008).*

Vlasiator is funded by the European Research Council and the Research Council of Finland.

Vlasiator requires considerable amount of human resources. The code is being developed by external funding. Runs are carried out with supercomputer resources that the PI team applies for from competitive sources (such as PRACE and CSC Grand Challenge). Each run needs to be babysat.

While Vlasiator is licensed under GPL-2, these rules of the road have a similar philosophy as are generally in use for instruments. Vlasiator is the only one of its kind in the world, having no similar benchmark. Hence we need to make sure that all Vlasiator results have been verified by by the PI-team.

The user is strongly advised to utilise Vlasiator as described below.

PI and the PI-team
